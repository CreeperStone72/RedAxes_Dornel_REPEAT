# Norsevar

## What is the game about?

Norsevar is a Norse mythology-themed roguelite dungeon crawler game with a Hack nâ€™ Slash combat system, in which the player plays as a Viking with a one-handed axe, fighting his way through randomly generated rooms filled with enemies. Each room has to be cleared before being able to proceed to the next.  

After clearing a room, the player receives a random upgrade, which either increases his character stats (ex.: Attack damage, Health points, Armor, ...) or changes/enhances one of the abilities of the character (ex.: Dashing spawns an axe that spins around on the spot, dealing damage to enemies in its reach.). When the player dies, he respawns in his base, where he can buy permanent upgrades for his character and start the game again. After a set amount of rooms are cleared, a boss appears, which has to be defeated to move to the next layer. The game ends after the boss on the last layer is defeated.
